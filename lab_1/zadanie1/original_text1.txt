My name is Dima. I am a student of the second year of study. I study at the university. My hobby is music. When I have free time I usually go to the biggest music shop in my town and buy CDs with my favourite music. I have a big collection of CDs at home, but I can not resist the temptation of buying a new CD. That what I like to buy most of all. But when it comes to buying new clothes, I am really at a loss. I do not follow fashion very much. That's why I almost always have problems with finding the clothes that suit me. When I need new clothes, I usually go to a shop with my fried or relatives. Some of them are fond of fashion and may advise me the clothes that are becoming and suit me best.
