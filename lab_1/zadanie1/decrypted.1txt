MY NAME IS DIMA. I AM A STUDENT OF THE SECOND YEAR OF STUDY. I STUDY AT THE UNIVERSITY. MY HOBBY IS MUSIC. WHEN I HAVE FREE TIME I USUALLY GO TO THE BIGGEST MUSIC SHOP IN MY TOWN AND BUY CDS WITH MY FAVOURITE MUSIC. I HAVE A BIG COLLECTION OF CDS AT HOME, BUT I CAN NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF BUYING A NEW CD. THAT WHAT I LIKE TO BUY MOST OF ALL. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING NEW CLOTHES, I AM REALLY AT A LOSS. I DO NOT FOLLOW FASHION VERY MUCH. THAT'S WHY I ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH FINDING THE CLOTHES THAT SUIT ME. WHEN I NEED NEW CLOTHES, I USUALLY GO TO A SHOP WITH MY FRIED OR RELATIVES. SOME OF THEM ARE FOND OF FASHION AND MAY ADVISE ME THE CLOTHES THAT ARE BECOMING AND SUIT ME BEST.
