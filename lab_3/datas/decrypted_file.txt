Right now, I am studying Business Administration and Management program at the faculty of Economics. It lasts for 3 years, and when I finish it I will get a bachelor’s degree. After that, I am planning to apply for a master’s degree which is 2 more years. I study for this degree at the University of Pecs. It is a huge University with many campuses and dormitories. I am not a freshman; I am a sophomore. That is why I already know a lot of things about higher education. At the beginning of each semester, you have to enroll in your course. After that you register for the compulsory and optional subjects. You can choose from a great number of elective courses. You can do absolutely anything from yoga to programming If you choose to. After you finish your studies, you can calculate your GPA, it is the average of your marks during the semester. If you have it above 4, you can apply for different scholarships and grants.
